- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Soaps1; the name comes from my first ever World of Warcraft character in 2006, which was a human mage - it still exists today!
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in maths, science & golf
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning AI/ML applications in finance; but interested in broader applications too
- âš¡ Fun fact: I coded my first model in NetBeans in 2008
